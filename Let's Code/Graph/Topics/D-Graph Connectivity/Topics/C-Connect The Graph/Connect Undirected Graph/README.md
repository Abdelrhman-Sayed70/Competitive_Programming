# Connect Undirected Graph
- **For an undirected unconnected graph of `n components`, we can prove that to connect this graph we need `n - 1 edges` between different components**
- Which nodes will be connected using n - 1 edges? we need any node from each component in a vector and create an edge between each 2 consecutive nodes
