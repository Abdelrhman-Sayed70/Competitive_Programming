- **Tree with no cycles and min number of edges that make the unweighted graph connected** `minimally connected`
- V vertices and V - 1 edges
- Tree has no cycles
- A `complete undirected graph` has `v power (v - 2)` number of different spanning trees
- Adding one edge in the component will make a cycle
