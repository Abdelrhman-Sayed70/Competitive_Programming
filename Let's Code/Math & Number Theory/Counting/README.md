# Counting

# Addition `Disjoint Events`
**in case of disjoint events. `total number of ways = summation of wayes`**

Someone wants to travel from A to B. he can travel by sea, road, and air
- 2 ways by sea
- 3 ways by air
- 2 ways by road
- So **Total number of wayes = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7** 


# Multiplication `Joint Events`


# Number of subsequences
number of non-zero subsequence = `(2^n) - 1`

# Number of subarrays
`n * (n + 1) / 2`
