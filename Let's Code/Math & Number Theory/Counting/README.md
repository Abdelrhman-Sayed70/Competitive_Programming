# Counting

# Addition `Disjoint Events`
**in case of disjoint events. `total number of ways = summation of wayes`**

Someone wants to travel from A to B. he can travel by sea, road, and air
- 2 ways by sea
- 3 ways by air
- 2 ways by road
So **Total number of wayes = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7** 


# Multiplication `Joint Events`
**In case of joint events. `total number of ways = multiplication of ways`**

Someone wants to travel from A to D passing by B, C
- 2 ways to travel from A to B
- 4 ways to travel from B to C
- 3 ways to travel from C to D

So **Total number of ways = 2 * 4 * 3**

# Number of subsequences
number of non-zero subsequence = `(2^n) - 1`

# Number of subarrays
`n * (n + 1) / 2`

# Permutation
**number of ways to arrange r different objects from n objects**
```
nPr = n! / (n - r)!
