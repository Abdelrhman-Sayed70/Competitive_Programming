# Decompose Number to Sum of Primes
**Any number can be summation of 1, 2 or 3 primes (or more of course)**

## Number is a summation of `1 prime`
- the number is prime

## Number is a summation of `2 primes`
- the number is even
- the number is odd and n - 2 is prime. first number = n - 2, second number = 2

## Number is a summation of `3 primes`
- the number is odd and the above condition is not satisfied ^_^
